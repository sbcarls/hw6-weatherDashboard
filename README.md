# hw6-weatherDashboard

This homework assignment was to create a weather app that would allow the user to type in the name of a city and get the current day forecast, as well as a 5 day forecast. There would also be a history of searched cities that could be clicked on to display that city's information again. I was able to set up the initial HTML page, added a little stlying with CSS, and attempted to write the Java script code needed to make it functional. I was unfortunently unable to get it working. I had at one point got it to at least console log the information, but I made a bunch of changes and it broke and I was unable to get it working again. This project included HTML, CSS, Java script, Bootstrap, OpenWeather API, and fonts awesome.
